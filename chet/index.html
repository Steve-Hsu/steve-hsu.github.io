      My funny valentine...<br />
      Sweet, comic valentine...<br />
      You make me smile with my heart<br />
      Your looks are laughable, unphotographable<br />
      Yet you're my favorite work of art<br />
    </div>
    <div class="s1_w2">
      Is your figure less than Greek?<br />
      Is your mouth a little weak?<br />
      When you open it to speak,<br />
      Are you smart?<br />
    </div>
    <div class="s1_w3">
      But don't change a hair for me<br />
      Not if you care for me<br />
      Stay little valentine<br />
      Stay...<br /><br />
      Each day is valentine's day.<br />

      You don't know what love is
    </div>
    <div class="s4_w1">
      You don't know what love is <br />
      Until you've learned the meaning of the blues<br />
      Until you've loved a love you had to loose<br />
      You don't know what love is<br />
    </div>
    <div class="s4_w2">
      You don't know how lips hurt<br />
      Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost<br />
      Until you've flipped you're heart and you have lost<br />
      You don't know what love is<br />
    </div>
    <div class="s4_w3">
      Do you know how a lost heart fears<br />
      The thought of reminiscing<br />
      And how lips have taste of tears<br />
      Loose the taste for kissing<br />
    </div>
    <div class="s4_w4">
      You don't know how hearts burn<br />
      For love that cannot live, yet never dies<br />
      Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes<br />
      You don't know what love is<br />
    </div>
    <div class="s4_w5">
      You don't know how hearts burn<br />
      For love that cannot live, yet never dies<br />
      Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes<br />
      How could you know what love is, what love is<br />
      What love is<br />

      《I'm A Fool To Want You》<br />
      I'm A Fool To Want You<br />
      I'm A Fool To Want You<br />
      To Want A Love That Can't Be True<br />
      A Love That's There For Others Too<br /><br />

      I'm A Fool To Hold You<br />
      Such A Fool To Hold You<br />
      To Seek A Kiss Not Mine Alone<br />
      To Share A Kiss The Devil Has Known<br /><br />

      Time And Time Again I Said I'd Leave You<br />
      Time And Time Again I Went Away<br />
      Then There'd Come The Time When I Would Need You<br />
      And Once Again These Words I'd Have To Say<br /><br />

      I'm A Fool To Want You<br />
      Pity Me I Need You<br />
      I Know Its Wrong<br /><br />
      It Must Be Wrong<br /><br />
      But Right Or Wrong<br />
      I Can't Get Along Without You<br /><br />
      Time And Time Again I Said I'd Leave You<br />
      Time And Time Again I Went Away<br />
      Then There'd Come The Time When I Would Need You<br />
      And Once Again These Words I'd Have To Say<br /><br />
      I'm A Fool To Want You<br />
      Pity Me I Need You<br />
      I Know Its Wrong<br />
      It Must Be Wrong<br />
      But Right Or Wrong<br />
      I Can't Get Along Without You<br /><br />

    <div class="P6_words">
      《Almost blue》<br />
      Almost blue<br /><br />
      Almost doing things we used to do<br />
      There's a gril here and she's almost you<br />
      Almost <br />
      all the things that your eyes once promised<br />
      I see in her too<br />
      Now your eyes are red from crying<br /><br />
      Almost blue<br /><br />
      Flirting with this disaster became me<br />
      It named me as the fool who only aimed to be<br />
      Almost blue<br /><br />
      It's almost touching it will almost do<br />
      There's a part of me that's always true...always<br />
      Not all good things come to an end now it is only a chosen few<br />
      I've seen such an unhappy couple<br />
      Almost me<br />
      Almost you<br />
      Almost blue<br />
